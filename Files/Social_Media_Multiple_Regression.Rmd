# Performing multiple regression on mtcars dataset
fit <- lm(Trouble_sleep~Instagram + Snapchat + Twitter, data=lay_data) # LM- ASSUMES IT TO BE IT LINEAR, y(mpg)- many variables-output-residuals means error -median of the errors- median means real minus predicted


#show the results
summary(fit)

```
# MODEL FIT 

INSIGHTS :
The significance of each coefficient is determined by examining their associated t-values and p-values. A p-value below 0.05 indicates statistical significance, suggesting that the predictor variable plays a meaningful role in explaining the variability observed in trouble with sleep.


```{r }
fit <- lm(Trouble_sleep~Instagram + Snapchat + Twitter, data=lay_data)#removed the values that were 0.05

qqPlot(fit, main="QQ Plot")

```

INSIGHTS : 
Residuals denote the disparities between the observed values of the response variable (Trouble_sleep) and the values predicted by the regression model.

For instance, individuals such as masinl, Patty, tl868, trave, ds2134, Harvey, ki567, and MVA37@S exhibit negative residuals, implying that the model's predicted trouble with sleep surpasses their actual trouble with sleep. Conversely, individuals like peace, 19!@s, ak2001, vp1234, and 15801 display positive residuals, suggesting that the model underestimates their trouble with sleep compared to their actual experiences.

# view results
plot(leaps)
plot(leaps,scale="r2")
plot(leaps,scale="bic")
summary(leaps)

```

INSIGHTS :
The comparison between Model 1 and Model 2 indicates that whether the variables Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter are included or excluded, it does not substantially affect the model's capacity to account for the variability in Trouble_sleep.


# MODEL PREDICTION

```{r }
library(relaimpo)
calc.relimp(fit,type=c("lmg","last","first","pratt"),
            rela=TRUE)
# Bootstrap Measures of Relative Importance (1000 samples)
boot <- boot.relimp(fit, b = 1000, type = c("lmg",
                                            "last", "first", "pratt"), rank = TRUE,
                    diff = TRUE, rela = TRUE)
booteval.relimp(boot) # print result

#https://rpubs.com/davoodastaraky/mtRegression
summary(fit)
predict.lm(fit, data.frame(Instagram =0.2 ,Snapchat=0.1,Twitter=0.5) )





```

INSIGHTS :
The forecasted value for Trouble_sleep is approximately 0.2391868.

Explanation: This suggests that when Instagram has a value of 0.2, Snapchat is 0.1, and Twitter is 0.5, the model anticipates Trouble_sleep to be approximately 0.2391868.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
